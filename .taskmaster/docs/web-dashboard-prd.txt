# Task Master Web Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Task Master Web Dashboard is a centralized web-based platform that aggregates and manages tasks from multiple Task Master projects. It provides a unified interface for developers and teams to view, monitor, and manage tasks across their entire project portfolio through git integration and real-time synchronization.

## Problem Statement

Currently, Task Master operates as a per-project CLI tool where each project maintains its own `.taskmaster/tasks.json` file. This creates several challenges:

- **Context Switching**: Developers working on multiple projects must constantly switch directories and contexts to view task status
- **No Portfolio View**: No unified view of work across all projects
- **Team Collaboration**: Limited visibility into project status for team members
- **Progress Tracking**: No centralized analytics or insights across projects
- **Project Discovery**: Manual tracking of which projects have Task Master enabled

## Vision

Create a centralized web dashboard that serves as the "mission control" for all Task Master projects, enabling developers and teams to:

- View all projects and their task status from one place
- Get real-time updates via git integration
- Collaborate effectively with shared visibility
- Gain insights through cross-project analytics
- Manage multiple projects efficiently

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Project Management
- **Auto-Discovery**: Scan connected git repositories for `.taskmaster/` directories
- **Project Registration**: Manual project addition with git repository links
- **Project Overview**: High-level status dashboard for all projects
- **Project Filtering**: Search, filter, and organize projects by tags, status, or activity

### 2. Git Integration & Real-time Sync
- **OAuth Integration**: Connect GitHub/GitLab accounts for repository access
- **Webhook Listeners**: Real-time updates when task files change via git commits
- **Branch Awareness**: Support for Task Master's tagged task system mapped to git branches
- **Conflict Detection**: Handle merge conflicts and sync issues gracefully

### 3. Task Visualization & Management
- **Unified Task View**: See all tasks from all projects in one interface
- **Project-Specific Views**: Drill down into individual project task lists
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time task status updates across projects
- **Dependency Visualization**: Cross-project task dependencies and relationships

### 4. Collaboration Features
- **Team Dashboards**: Shared views for team projects
- **Access Control**: Permission-based project access
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time updates on task changes across projects
- **Comments & Notes**: Collaborative task discussion (future enhancement)

### 5. Analytics & Insights
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Task completion rates across all projects
- **Project Health**: Identify stalled or problematic projects
- **Velocity Tracking**: Team and individual productivity insights
- **Complexity Analysis**: Aggregate complexity data across projects

### 6. API & Integration
- **REST API**: Programmatic access to all dashboard functionality
- **CLI Integration**: Enhanced Task Master CLI commands for dashboard interaction
- **Export Capabilities**: Export task data in various formats
- **Webhook Support**: Trigger external systems based on task events

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Web Application)
- **Framework**: React with Next.js for SSR/SSG capabilities
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand for complex state
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS with Headless UI or similar
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live updates
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for OAuth integration

### Backend (API Server)
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express or Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server for live updates
- **Queue System**: Bull/BullMQ for background job processing
- **Git Integration**: GitHub/GitLab API clients

### Data Architecture
```
Projects (id, name, git_url, owner_id, created_at, updated_at)
Tasks (id, project_id, task_id, title, status, priority, data_json)
Users (id, email, github_id, gitlab_id, created_at)
ProjectMembers (project_id, user_id, role, access_level)
SyncHistory (id, project_id, commit_sha, sync_status, updated_at)
```

### Git Integration Flow
1. User connects GitHub/GitLab account via OAuth
2. System scans repositories for `.taskmaster/` directories
3. Webhook endpoints registered for Task Master projects
4. On git push, webhook triggers sync process
5. System pulls latest task files and updates database
6. WebSocket broadcasts changes to connected clients

## User Experience

### Dashboard Views
1. **Portfolio Overview**: Grid/list view of all projects with status indicators
2. **Project Detail**: Individual project task breakdown with full Task Master functionality
3. **Cross-Project Tasks**: Unified task list across all projects with filtering
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Charts and metrics for portfolio insights

### Key User Flows
1. **Project Discovery**: Connect git account → Auto-discover projects → Review and enable
2. **Daily Workflow**: View dashboard → See updated tasks → Click into specific projects → Monitor progress
3. **Team Collaboration**: Invite team members → Set project permissions → Share project dashboards

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of projects registered
- Daily/monthly active users
- Projects with regular sync activity
- Team adoption (projects with multiple users)

### Engagement Metrics
- Dashboard page views per user per day
- Average session duration
- Project drill-down rates
- Cross-project navigation patterns

### Productivity Metrics
- Task completion velocity across projects
- Time to project setup (discovery to first sync)
- Reduction in context switching (measured via user surveys)
- Team collaboration improvement indicators

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (MVP)
- Basic project registration and git OAuth
- Simple project listing with task counts
- Basic webhook sync for single project
- Minimal web interface

### Phase 2: Multi-Project Management
- Project auto-discovery
- Cross-project task views
- Real-time sync for all projects
- Enhanced UI with filtering/search

### Phase 3: Collaboration & Analytics
- Team/user management
- Project sharing and permissions
- Analytics dashboard
- Advanced visualizations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Cross-project dependencies
- Advanced reporting
- Mobile responsive design
- API ecosystem

## Technical Considerations

### Scalability
- Database indexing for fast project/task queries
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Rate limiting for git API calls
- Horizontal scaling for webhook processing

### Security
- OAuth 2.0 for git provider authentication
- JWT tokens for session management
- RBAC for project access control
- Secure webhook validation

### Performance
- Lazy loading for large project lists
- Optimistic updates for UI responsiveness
- Background sync processing
- CDN for static assets

### Reliability
- Error handling for git sync failures
- Retry mechanisms for webhook processing
- Graceful degradation when git providers are unavailable
- Data backup and recovery procedures

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- ✅ Successfully sync 95% of webhook events within 30 seconds
- ✅ Support 1000+ projects per instance
- ✅ <500ms average page load times
- ✅ 99.9% uptime for dashboard access

### User Success
- ✅ Reduce project context switching time by 60%
- ✅ Increase task visibility across teams by 80%
- ✅ Enable portfolio management for 100+ project developers
- ✅ Achieve 70% daily active user rate among registered users

This PRD establishes the foundation for building a comprehensive, git-integrated Task Master Web Dashboard that transforms the single-project CLI tool into a powerful multi-project management platform.
