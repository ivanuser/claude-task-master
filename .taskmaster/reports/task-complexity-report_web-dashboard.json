		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Web Dashboard Project Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the web dashboard project setup into specific implementation steps including Next.js app initialization, TypeScript configuration, folder structure creation, dependency installation, development environment setup, and integration with existing Task Master core modules. Consider the existing monorepo structure with apps/ directory and current build systems.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to existing monorepo structure with apps/extension already present. Requires careful integration with existing CLI tools and maintaining consistency with current architecture patterns. The presence of workspaces and existing build tools reduces complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and Migration System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive database implementation including PostgreSQL schema design, Prisma ORM setup, migration system, connection pooling, indexing strategy, Redis caching integration, and seed data scripts. Focus on multi-project task management data models and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as the current system is entirely file-based with no existing database infrastructure. Requires complete architectural shift from JSON files to relational database, new ORM integration, caching layer, and data migration strategy from existing task files."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Build OAuth Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement comprehensive OAuth 2.0 authentication system with NextAuth.js including GitHub/GitLab provider configuration, JWT token management, session handling, role-based access control, user profile management, security middleware, and API route protection.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity requiring integration of multiple OAuth providers, secure token management, and RBAC system. No existing authentication infrastructure to build upon, requiring complete implementation from scratch with security best practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Create Git Integration and Repository Scanning",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build Git integration system including GitHub/GitLab API clients, repository scanning for .taskmaster directories, project auto-discovery with pagination, webhook endpoint creation, signature validation, background job processing with Bull/BullMQ, and rate limiting management.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity involving external API integrations, webhook handling, and background processing. Requires understanding of GitHub/GitLab APIs, secure webhook validation, and scalable job processing architecture."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Real-time Sync Engine",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create sophisticated sync engine handling webhook event processing, database synchronization, conflict resolution for concurrent updates, Task Master tagged task system parsing, queue system with retry logic, WebSocket connections for live updates, branch-aware synchronization, and comprehensive error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as core synchronization system bridging git repositories and database. Must handle existing Task Master's tagged task system, legacy format compatibility, conflict resolution, real-time updates, and maintain data consistency across distributed environments."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Build Portfolio Dashboard Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create responsive dashboard UI with React/Next.js/Tailwind including project grid/list views, status indicators, filtering system, search functionality with fuzzy matching, drag-and-drop organization, project status widgets, completion rate displays, and infinite scrolling implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity leveraging existing React/Tailwind infrastructure in apps/extension. Can reuse existing UI components and patterns from the VS Code extension. Main challenge is responsive design and performance optimization for large datasets."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Detail and Task Management Views",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive project detail pages with full Task Master functionality including task CRUD operations, status management, priority changes, dependency management, rich text editing modals, subtask expansion/collapse, drag-and-drop reorganization, bulk operations, filtering/sorting, and CLI command integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring feature parity with existing CLI commands and Task Master functionality. Must integrate with existing task management logic while providing intuitive web interface. Complex state management and real-time synchronization requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Create REST API and WebSocket Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive API system including RESTful endpoints for all operations, OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, WebSocket server for real-time updates, rate limiting and throttling, Zod schema validation, API versioning, caching layers, monitoring, and analytics integration.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity requiring complete API architecture design. Must provide RESTful interface to all Task Master functionality while maintaining performance and security. WebSocket integration adds real-time complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Build Analytics and Reporting Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create analytics system including data models for productivity tracking, velocity metrics calculation, project health indicators, data aggregation jobs, interactive visualizations with Chart.js/D3.js, customizable dashboard widgets, report export functionality, team comparisons, and predictive insights.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity involving data analysis, visualization, and reporting features. Requires design of analytics data models, aggregation algorithms, and interactive charts. Export functionality and predictive insights add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Team Collaboration and Access Control",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build team collaboration system including member invitation/management, granular RBAC with custom permissions, project sharing with access levels, real-time activity feeds, notification system, commenting functionality, audit logging for security/compliance, and team dashboard aggregated metrics.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring sophisticated permission system, real-time collaboration features, and security considerations. Must integrate with authentication system and provide granular access control across all features while maintaining security isolation."
