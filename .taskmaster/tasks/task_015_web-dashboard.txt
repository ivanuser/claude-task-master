# Task ID: 15
# Title: Develop Real-time Sync Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core synchronization engine for real-time task updates across git repositories and database
# Details:
Create sync service that processes webhook events and updates database in real-time. Implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates to task files. Build task file parser that handles Task Master's tagged task system and legacy format. Create queue system for processing sync jobs with retry mechanisms. Implement WebSocket connections for live updates to connected clients. Handle branch awareness for Task Master's tag system mapped to git branches. Add comprehensive error handling and logging.

# Test Strategy:
Test concurrent sync operations, conflict resolution scenarios, WebSocket connection stability, queue processing reliability, parsing of different task file formats, and error recovery mechanisms. Performance test with high-frequency webhook events.
