Build real-time task notification system:
- Extend existing Socket.IO implementation for real-time notifications

- Implement deadline and overdue task notifications with scheduling
- Add notification history and read/unread status tracking
- Create notification dropdown/panel component for in-app notifications
- Integrate with push notification system for background notifications
- Add notification sound settings and visual indicators
- Implement notification batching to prevent spam

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time delivery across multiple browser tabs, verify notification history persistence, test mention detection accuracy, validate deadline notifications trigger correctly, ensure notification preferences are respected
