# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 18, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive settings page with user profile management, account settings, notification preferences, theme customization, API key management, integrations configuration, billing/subscription management, data export/import, and security settings including 2FA.
# Details:
Build a complete settings page serving as the central hub for user account management and application configuration. Implement user profile section with avatar upload, display name, email management, and connected accounts (GitHub/GitLab). Create account settings with password change, email verification, and account deletion options. Build notification preferences interface integrating with existing notification system from Task 23. Implement theme customization with light/dark mode toggle, color scheme selection, and UI density options. Create API key management section for generating, viewing, and revoking personal access tokens for CLI integration. Build integrations configuration panel for managing third-party service connections (Slack, Discord, email providers). Implement billing/subscription management with plan selection, payment method management, usage tracking, and invoice history. Create data export/import functionality for backing up user data, projects, and settings with multiple format support (JSON, CSV). Build comprehensive security settings including 2FA setup with TOTP/SMS options, active session management, login history, and security audit logs. Implement form validation using Zod schemas, optimistic updates for better UX, and proper error handling. Use React Hook Form for form state management and integrate with existing database schema from Task 12. Create responsive design following existing dashboard patterns and ensure accessibility compliance.

# Test Strategy:
Test user profile updates with avatar upload/removal and verify database persistence. Validate password change functionality with proper authentication and security checks. Test notification preferences sync with existing notification system and verify real-time updates. Validate theme switching persists across browser sessions and applies to all dashboard components. Test API key generation/revocation and verify proper authentication with CLI tools. Test integrations configuration with actual third-party services and webhook validation. Validate billing functionality with test payment processors and subscription management. Test data export generates complete and accurate files, and import properly restores user settings. Test 2FA setup/removal with various authenticator apps and backup codes functionality. Verify security settings show accurate session information and audit logs. Test form validation handles all edge cases and provides clear error messages. Validate responsive design across devices and screen sizes.
