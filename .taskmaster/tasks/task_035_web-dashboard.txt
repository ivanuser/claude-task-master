# Title: Build Third-party Integration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 34
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive integration framework supporting GitHub, Slack, Google Calendar, Jira, and custom webhooks
# Details:
Implement integration system with:
- OAuth2 flow implementation for GitHub, Google, Slack integrations
- GitHub integration for issue syncing and commit linking
- Slack integration for notifications and task updates
- Google Calendar sync for deadline and milestone management
- Jira integration for ticket synchronization
- Custom webhook system for third-party services
- Integration status monitoring and error handling
- Connection testing and validation
- Data mapping configuration for different services
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Integration activity logs and debugging
- Bulk data import/export capabilities
- Integration marketplace for community connectors

# Test Strategy:
Test OAuth flows for each service, verify data synchronization accuracy, test webhook delivery and signature validation, validate rate limiting prevents API abuse, ensure error handling provides clear user feedback
