# Title: Enhance Theme System with Advanced Customization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend existing theme implementation with database persistence, system theme detection, and smooth transitions
# Details:
Improve existing ThemeSection component with:
- Database persistence for theme preferences (replace localStorage)
- Server-side theme rendering to prevent flash of unstyled content
- CSS custom property system for theme variables
- Smooth theme transitions with CSS animations
- System theme preference detection and auto-switching
- High contrast mode support for accessibility
- Theme preview functionality with live updates
- Custom color picker for advanced users
- Theme export/import functionality for sharing
- Integration with user settings API endpoints
- Prefers-reduced-motion respect for transitions
- Dark mode optimized images and icons

# Test Strategy:
Test theme persistence across sessions, verify smooth transitions between themes, test system preference detection, validate accessibility compliance, ensure custom colors work across all components
