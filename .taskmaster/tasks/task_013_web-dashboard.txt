# Task ID: 13
# Title: Build OAuth Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication with GitHub and GitLab integration for secure user authentication
# Details:
Integrate NextAuth.js with GitHub and GitLab OAuth providers. Create authentication API routes (/api/auth/[...nextauth].js). Implement JWT token management with secure session handling. Create user management system with role-based access control (RBAC). Setup middleware for protected routes and API endpoints. Create user profile management with linked git accounts. Handle OAuth callback security and user data synchronization.

# Test Strategy:
Test OAuth flow with both GitHub and GitLab, token refresh mechanisms, session security, RBAC permissions, logout functionality, and edge cases like revoked tokens or expired sessions.
