# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Fully Functional Notifications Page with Real-Time System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 18, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive notifications system with real-time WebSocket updates, notification center UI, user preferences, email/push integration, history management, and filtering capabilities.
# Details:
Build a complete notifications page that serves as the central hub for all user notifications across projects and teams. Implement real-time WebSocket connections for instant notification delivery using the existing WebSocket infrastructure. Create notification database schema with tables for Notifications (id, user_id, type, title, message, read_status, created_at, project_id, task_id, team_id), NotificationPreferences (user_id, email_enabled, push_enabled, notification_types), and NotificationHistory for audit trails. Build notification center UI with categorized views (all, unread, mentions, project updates, team activities). Implement comprehensive filtering system by type, project, team, date range, and read status. Create notification preferences panel allowing users to configure email and push notification settings per category. Integrate with existing team collaboration system for team-based notifications and mentions. Build email notification service using transactional email provider (SendGrid/AWS SES) with customizable templates. Implement push notification support using service workers for web push. Create batch operations for mark all as read, bulk delete, and notification cleanup. Add notification sound preferences and browser notification permissions handling. Implement notification aggregation to prevent spam (e.g., multiple task updates from same project). Create notification webhooks for external integrations.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time WebSocket delivery across multiple browser sessions and verify notifications appear instantly. Test email notification delivery with various templates and ensure proper SMTP/API integration. Validate push notification functionality across different browsers and devices. Test notification filtering with complex combinations and verify performance with large notification datasets. Test user preferences persist correctly and affect notification behavior as expected. Verify notification history maintains proper audit trails and cleanup schedules work correctly. Test notification aggregation prevents spam while maintaining important updates. Validate all CRUD operations on notifications maintain data integrity and security isolation between users.
