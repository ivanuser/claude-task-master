# Task ID: 27
# Title: Enhance Analytics Dashboard with Advanced Visualization and Real-Time Data Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 25, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the existing analytics dashboard into a comprehensive data visualization system with interactive charts, real-time metrics, customizable reporting, and predictive analytics capabilities.
# Details:
Build upon the existing analytics foundation to create a sophisticated data visualization platform. Implement Chart.js or Recharts for interactive charts including line charts for velocity tracking, bar charts for task completion metrics, pie charts for project distribution, and burndown charts for sprint progress. Create customizable date range selectors with preset options (last 7 days, month, quarter, year) and custom date pickers. Build real-time WebSocket integration to display live metrics updates without page refresh. Implement exportable report generation with PDF export using jsPDF/Puppeteer and CSV export functionality for raw data analysis. Create team performance comparison views with side-by-side metrics, individual contributor analytics, and team velocity comparisons. Build project comparison dashboard with multi-project overlay charts and comparative analysis tools. Implement task completion trend analysis with moving averages, seasonal patterns, and completion rate predictions. Add velocity tracking with sprint-over-sprint comparisons, team capacity planning, and throughput analysis. Create comprehensive burndown charts for active projects with ideal vs actual progress lines and completion forecasting. Integrate predictive analytics using historical data to forecast project completion dates, identify potential bottlenecks, and suggest resource allocation optimizations. Connect to live database with optimized queries for real-time data fetching and implement data caching strategies for performance. Add dashboard customization options allowing users to configure widget layouts, select preferred chart types, and create personalized analytics views.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time chart updates by creating/updating tasks and verifying immediate dashboard reflection. Validate all chart types render correctly with various data sets and edge cases (empty data, single data point, large datasets). Test date range functionality with different time periods and verify accurate data filtering. Test export functionality by generating PDF reports with charts and CSV files, ensuring data integrity and formatting. Verify team performance metrics accuracy by comparing with raw database queries. Test project comparison views with multiple projects and validate comparative calculations. Test predictive analytics accuracy by comparing predictions with actual outcomes over time. Validate database connection performance under load and verify caching mechanisms work correctly. Test dashboard customization features including widget reordering, chart type switching, and layout persistence across sessions.
