# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Database Schema and Migration System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the PostgreSQL database schema for multi-project task management with migration system
# Details:
Setup PostgreSQL database with tables: Projects (id, name, git_url, owner_id, created_at, updated_at), Tasks (id, project_id, task_id, title, status, priority, data_json), Users (id, email, github_id, gitlab_id, created_at), ProjectMembers (project_id, user_id, role, access_level), SyncHistory (id, project_id, commit_sha, sync_status, updated_at). Use Prisma ORM for schema management and migrations. Create database connection pooling with appropriate indices for performance. Implement seed data scripts for development. Setup Redis for caching layer.

# Test Strategy:
Test database schema creation, migration rollback/forward, connection pooling under load, data integrity constraints, and index performance. Verify seed data loads correctly and Redis caching functions properly.
