# Task ID: 32
# Title: Create Advanced Quiet Hours System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement intelligent notification scheduling with timezone awareness and emergency override capabilities
# Details:
Build sophisticated quiet hours system:
- Timezone-aware quiet hours scheduling using date-fns or moment-timezone
- Daily quiet hours configuration (e.g., 10 PM - 8 AM)
- Weekend notification preferences with custom schedules
- Holiday calendar integration for extended quiet periods
- Emergency notification override system for critical alerts
- Team-wide quiet hours policies with individual overrides
- Notification queuing during quiet hours with batch delivery
- Smart quiet hours suggestions based on user activity patterns
- Integration with user settings API for persistence
- Visual indicators for quiet hours status in UI
- Automatic quiet hours activation based on calendar events

# Test Strategy:
Test timezone calculations accuracy, verify quiet hours prevent notifications correctly, test emergency override functionality, validate weekend preferences work independently, ensure notification queuing and batch delivery works properly
