# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Two-Factor Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive 2FA system with TOTP, backup codes, SMS fallback, and recovery processes
# Details:
Build 2FA security system:
- TOTP implementation using speakeasy library for authenticator app support
- QR code generation for easy authenticator app setup
- Backup codes generation and secure storage (hashed)
- SMS fallback using Twilio or similar service
- Recovery process for lost devices and backup codes
- 2FA enforcement policies for organizations
- Session management with 2FA verification
- 2FA setup wizard with step-by-step guidance
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Audit logging for all 2FA events
- Rate limiting for 2FA attempts
- Device trust management (remember device option)
- Admin override capabilities for account recovery

# Test Strategy:
Test TOTP codes work with popular authenticator apps, verify backup codes work only once, test SMS delivery and validation, validate recovery process security, ensure rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
