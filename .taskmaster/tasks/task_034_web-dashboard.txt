# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Comprehensive API Key Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace mock API key functionality with secure key generation, usage tracking, and management system
# Details:
Build secure API key management system:
- Cryptographically secure API key generation using crypto.randomBytes
- API key hashing and storage (never store plain text keys)
- Key expiration date management with automatic cleanup
- Usage statistics and rate limiting per key
- Key revocation and regeneration functionality
- Scope-based permissions for different API endpoints
- Key usage analytics dashboard with charts
- API key testing interface within settings
- Key rotation notifications and recommendations
- Integration with rate limiting middleware
- Audit logging for all key operations
- Personal access tokens vs. application keys distinction

# Test Strategy:
Test key generation uniqueness and security, verify rate limiting works per key, test key revocation immediately blocks access, validate usage statistics accuracy, ensure audit logging captures all operations
