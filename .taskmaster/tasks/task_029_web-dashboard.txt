# Description: Implement comprehensive email notification system with customizable templates and delivery preferences
# Details:
Create email notification system with:
- Email service using Nodemailer or similar for SMTP delivery
- HTML email templates for different notification types (daily digest, instant alerts, task updates)
- Email template engine (Handlebars or React Email) for dynamic content
- User email preference management (frequency, types, unsubscribe)
- Queue system using Bull/BullMQ for reliable email delivery
- Unsubscribe link generation and handling in all emails
- Email bounce and delivery tracking
- Database schema updates for email preferences and delivery logs

Test email delivery across different providers, verify template rendering, test unsubscribe functionality, validate email preferences persist correctly, ensure queue processes emails reliably under load
