# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 20, 22, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive projects management interface with full CRUD operations, project creation wizard, settings management, Git repository integration, member management, task views, health metrics, and activity timeline with complete database integration.
# Details:
Build a complete projects page that serves as the central hub for project management and administration. Implement project creation wizard with step-by-step setup including project templates, initial team assignment, Git repository connection, and basic configuration options. Create comprehensive CRUD operations with project editing modal, bulk operations for multiple projects, and soft delete with recovery options. Build project settings management interface with project metadata, visibility controls, default task templates, and integration configurations. Implement Git repository integration UI with repository connection wizard, branch management, commit history display, and deployment status tracking. Create project member management with role-based access controls, member invitation system, permission matrix, and member activity tracking. Build project-specific task views with filtering by project context, task statistics, progress visualization, and project timeline. Implement project health metrics dashboard with completion rates, velocity tracking, team productivity metrics, and trend analysis. Create comprehensive activity timeline showing project events, member actions, task updates, and milestone achievements. Integrate with existing team management system from Task 22 for seamless member assignment and role inheritance. Connect to real database with optimized queries for project aggregation, member relationships, and activity tracking. Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach and progressive web app capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test project creation wizard with various templates and configurations, validating database persistence and initial setup accuracy. Verify all CRUD operations including project editing, bulk operations, and soft delete/recovery functionality. Test Git repository integration with different providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and validate connection, branch tracking, and commit history display. Test project member management with invitation workflows, role assignments, permission enforcement, and activity tracking accuracy. Verify project-specific task views display correct data with proper filtering and aggregation across large datasets. Test project health metrics calculations with historical data and validate trend analysis accuracy. Test activity timeline with real-time updates, pagination, and filtering capabilities. Verify responsive design across different screen sizes and test progressive web app functionality including offline capabilities. Test integration with team management system and validate seamless role inheritance and member synchronization. Perform load testing with multiple projects, large member lists, and extensive task datasets to ensure optimal performance.
