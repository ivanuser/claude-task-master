# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Web Push Notifications System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace mock push notification settings with functional Web Push API implementation including subscription management and granular notification controls
# Details:
Implement browser push notifications using the Web Push API:
- Request notification permissions from users with proper UX
- Generate and manage push subscriptions using service workers
- Store push subscriptions in the database (user preferences table)
- Create notification service worker in public/service-worker.js
- Implement server-side push notification sending using web-push library
- Add granular notification type controls (task updates, mentions, deadlines)
- Integrate with existing notification preferences UI in NotificationPreferencesSection component
- Handle subscription renewal and error states
- Add notification click handling to navigate to relevant pages

# Test Strategy:
Test notification permission request flow, verify subscriptions are stored correctly, test sending notifications from server, validate notification types can be toggled, ensure notifications work across different browsers and devices
