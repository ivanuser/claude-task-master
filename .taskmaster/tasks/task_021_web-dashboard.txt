# Title: Implement Fully Functional Tasks Page with Complete Management Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 18, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive tasks management interface that aggregates and manages tasks across all projects with advanced filtering, sorting, search, and bulk operations capabilities.
# Details:
Build a centralized tasks page that displays tasks from all user projects in a unified interface. Implement advanced filtering options (status, priority, project, assignee, due date, tags). Create multi-column sortable table with customizable views (list, kanban, timeline). Add comprehensive search functionality with full-text search across task titles, descriptions, and details. Implement bulk operations for status updates, priority changes, project transfers, and deletion. Create task creation wizard that can assign tasks to any accessible project. Build inline task editing with rich text support and auto-save functionality. Add drag-and-drop task reorganization between projects and status columns. Implement task dependency visualization and management across projects. Create export functionality for task lists in multiple formats. Add advanced analytics widgets showing task distribution, completion trends, and productivity metrics. Integrate real-time updates via WebSocket for collaborative editing. Implement infinite scrolling with virtualization for performance with large task sets.

# Test Strategy:
Test cross-project task aggregation accuracy and performance with large datasets. Verify all filtering combinations work correctly and maintain performance. Test search functionality across different task fields and content types. Validate bulk operations handle edge cases and maintain data integrity. Test task creation workflow across different project contexts and permission levels. Verify inline editing auto-save and conflict resolution. Test drag-and-drop functionality across different project contexts with proper permission validation. Validate real-time updates work correctly for multiple concurrent users. Test export functionality with various data sizes and formats. Verify responsive design and accessibility compliance across all features.
