Add bulk task operations (status changes, priority updates). Create task filtering and sorting within projects. Integrate with existing Task Master CLI command equivalents through API.

Test all task CRUD operations, drag-and-drop task reordering, bulk operations performance, rich text editing, task filtering accuracy, and integration with backend Task Master logic. Verify feature parity with CLI commands.
