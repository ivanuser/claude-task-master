# Task ID: 11
# Title: Setup Web Dashboard Project Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational architecture for the Task Master Web Dashboard including project structure, development environment, and core dependencies
# Details:
Initialize a new web application structure within the existing Task Master project. Create apps/dashboard directory with Next.js framework. Setup package.json with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and core dependencies. Configure TypeScript, ESLint, and development scripts. Create initial folder structure: components/, pages/api/, lib/, hooks/, types/, and utils/. Setup environment configuration for development and production. Integrate with existing Task Master core modules and maintain consistency with current codebase architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully, all dependencies install correctly, development server starts without errors, TypeScript compilation passes, and basic routing works. Test integration with existing Task Master CLI tools.

Implementation completed successfully with comprehensive environment and development infrastructure:

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
- .env.example template created with all required variables for Next.js, API integration, Task Master CLI, and extensibility
- .env.local auto-generated for immediate local development
- Environment variables properly configured for development, staging, and production contexts
- Port 3001 configured to avoid conflicts with other services

DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATION:
- dev.config.js implemented with development utilities, health checking, and validation functions
- Interactive setup script (scripts/dev-setup.js) for automated environment initialization
- Development monitoring script (scripts/dev-monitor.js) for health tracking during development
- Enhanced package.json scripts for development workflow, validation, and Task Master integration

DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE:
- VS Code workspace settings optimized for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS
- Debug configurations added for Next.js development and API debugging
- README.dev.md documentation provides complete development guide
- Hot reloading and fast refresh properly configured
- Task Master CLI integration scripts enable seamless workflow

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- All code passes ESLint validation without errors
- TypeScript type checking verified across all new files
- Prettier formatting validated and consistent
- Development setup script tested and functional
- Configuration follows Next.js and monorepo best practices

The development environment is now production-ready with proper tooling, documentation, and integration capabilities.
