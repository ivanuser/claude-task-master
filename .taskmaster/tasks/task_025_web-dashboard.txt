# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Connection Status Monitoring and Offline Mode System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 18, 20, 21, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive offline detection and connection status monitoring with WebSocket heartbeat, automatic reconnection logic, offline data caching, and sync queue management for seamless offline-to-online transitions.
# Details:
Implement a robust connection monitoring system that tracks real-time WebSocket connection status using heartbeat mechanisms and connection state events. Create offline detection using navigator.onLine API combined with periodic connectivity checks to external endpoints. Build automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff strategy and maximum retry limits. Implement offline data caching using IndexedDB for storing user actions, task updates, and form data when offline. Create a sync queue system that stores all offline changes with timestamps and conflict resolution strategies. Build a connection status indicator component showing real-time connectivity status (online/offline/reconnecting) with visual feedback. Implement background sync service worker for handling data synchronization when connection is restored. Add offline-first data flow where all operations work locally first, then sync to server. Create conflict resolution UI for handling data conflicts when syncing offline changes. Implement progressive enhancement where core functionality remains available offline with degraded experience for server-dependent features. Add notification system to inform users of connection status changes and pending sync operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test connection status detection by simulating network disconnection and verifying accurate status display. Test automatic reconnection by killing WebSocket connection and validating exponential backoff behavior. Test offline data caching by performing task operations while offline and verifying data persistence in IndexedDB. Test sync queue functionality by creating multiple offline changes and validating proper synchronization order when reconnected. Test conflict resolution by making conflicting changes offline and online, then verifying resolution UI and data integrity. Test service worker background sync registration and execution. Test offline UI states and ensure core functionality remains accessible without network. Verify heartbeat mechanism maintains accurate connection status and handles network timeouts properly.
