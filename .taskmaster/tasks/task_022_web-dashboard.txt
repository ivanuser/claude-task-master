# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 18, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive team management interface with team creation, member invitation system, role management, permissions configuration, team settings, member activity tracking, and team collaboration tools with full database integration.
# Details:
Build a complete team management page that serves as the central hub for team administration and collaboration. Implement team creation wizard with customizable team settings, branding, and initial configuration options. Create a robust member invitation system with email invitations, invitation link generation, and multi-role invitation support. Build comprehensive role management interface allowing creation of custom roles with granular permission assignments (project access, task management, member management, analytics viewing, etc.). Implement real-time member activity tracking showing login history, task contributions, collaboration metrics, and engagement analytics. Create team settings panel for managing team-wide configurations, notification preferences, integration settings, and security policies. Build collaboration tools including team chat/messaging system, shared file repository, team announcements, and collaborative workspace features. Integrate with existing database schema to ensure data consistency and leverage existing user authentication, project associations, and permission systems. Create responsive UI components using the established design system with proper state management for real-time updates. Implement advanced search and filtering for large team member lists, bulk member operations, and team analytics dashboards.

# Test Strategy:
Test team creation workflow with various configurations and validate database persistence. Verify member invitation system sends emails correctly, handles invitation acceptance/rejection, and manages pending invitations. Test role management with custom role creation, permission inheritance, and access control enforcement across all features. Validate member activity tracking accuracy, real-time updates, and analytics calculations. Test team settings persistence and application across team features. Verify collaboration tools function correctly with real-time messaging, file uploads, and shared workspace access. Test responsive design across devices and ensure proper error handling for network failures, invalid permissions, and edge cases. Perform load testing with large teams and concurrent user operations.
